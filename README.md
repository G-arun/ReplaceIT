# ReplaceIT

Description to come soon, but the gist is:

This helps dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to convert Word-Filtered-HTML to useable HTML. It creates a backup of every file it touches, and it runs recursively.

In convert/html you will see two files.

1. 15033_1.htm.bak - This is what Word originally spat out.
2. 15033_1.htm - This is the result of the script in its current state. Much more manageable.

Many thanks to Michael Clark for a "find-and-replace" PowerShell script to start from, and for his expertise and help. If you're here on Github let me know so I can properly credit you.
