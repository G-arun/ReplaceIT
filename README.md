# ReplaceIT

There are a million reasons to NOT use Regex to parse HTML. There are very few times when this is your only option, and if it is your only option, this will help.

This is a set of PowerShell Scripts, just put ReplaceInFolder and ReplaceIT in a directory together and open PowerShell.

Run ReplaceInFolder on whathever folder contains your Word-"Filtered" HTML and it will scrape away 99% of Word's horrible useless code.

This creates a backup of and runs on every .htm file in the directory you specify. You can edit the acceptable extensions to add more if you like.

Many thanks to Michael Clark for his expertise and help. If you're here let me know so I can properly credit you.
